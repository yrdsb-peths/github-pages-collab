1. Make more changes to your page to personalize it. Perhaps add some of your favourite things and change the logo and add more images. Use ChatGPT or Copilot to learn more about how to make your page look nice.

1. Commit and push at each step. Github automatically updates your live webpage when you push changes to the `main` branch.
